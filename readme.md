**New users: Scroll down to QuickStart instructions**

**FindTheMag v3.0 Released Sep 2023.** This release comes with many usability and stability improvements. 
If you are an existing FTM user, you will need to re-make your config file as many variable
names have changed. I suggest downloading FTM into a new directory to avoid any conflicts with the old version.
And of course, customize your config file! To do this, copy the new config.py to a file named user_config.py and make your
edits there.

# About this tool
FindTheMag is a powerful utility which prints statistics from your BOINC client and offers suggestions to optimize your
crunching. If you ask it to, it will also control BOINC to crunch projects according to your
preferences. It even has options to only crunch according to profitability and/or temperature.

You can group BOINC projects into two groups: 
 * ‚ô• Ô∏è _Preferred_ projects are ones which you want to crunch regardless of how much GRC they get you. 
 * ü§ë _Mining_ projects are projects which you are willing to crunch, but only if they get you the maximum 
amount of GRC possible. In the event that your preferred project(s) happen to be the most efficient to mine, FindTheMag will 
assign all project weight to them.

FindTheMag uses your own BOINC client's stats to determine which projects get the most credit per hour on your machine. 
It then figures out which projects earn you the most Gridcoin.

<b>If you find this tool useful</b>, consider sidestaking or donating
some GRC to me at RzUgcntbFm8PeSJpauk6a44qbtu92dpw3K

This tool's accuracy improves the longer you have been running BOINC. It will automatically set all Gridcoin-approved 
projects to a weight of one (if you have BOINC control enabled and are attached to all projects) so they will continue
to use a small portion of your processing power (total of 1% of all crunching time), each time increasing the accuracy of the tool.

It is strongly suggested to have the Gridcoin wallet running on your machine (fully synced). If you do not have it 
installed, it will try to fetch statistics from gridcoinstats.eu. This is less reliable in case of network issues and 
is limited to once per day. The wallet doesn't need any coins in it, just an up-to-date copy of the blockchain. Your
machine also requires **python 3.8 or higher**, earlier versions will not work. If you just 
installed BOINC, this tool takes about 48 hours to start working as we have to wait for projects to grant you credit 
for your work. Though really a week's worth of data is about the minimum you'd need to get useful information from this
tool.

Special thanks to <a href="https://github.com/nielstron/pyboinc">PyBOINC</a> which this program uses extensively

<b>If you only want to use this tool to get stats and suggested project weights but not control BOINC directly:</b>
 * If you use an account manager like BAM:
   * Put each host into its own host group
   * Assign weight to projects in the host group
   * Both [Arikado pool](https://grc.arikado.ru/) and [GRCPool](http://grcpool.com) can set project weight on a per-host basis.


 * If you manage your BOINC client locally
   * There is no way to set project weight outside of logging in to each project manually and setting it there. 
   * You can still use this tool to find out the mag/hr of various projects and "no new tasks" projects you have no interest in crunching either because of low mag/hr or because they are not your preferred projects. This can be done locally on your BOINC client.

<b>If you use this utility to directly control your BOINC crunching:</b>
 * **After around 1000 hours of crunching with FTM, 5% of your processing power will be donated to development unless you have a sidestake setup**. I hope you will see that this is only a small portion of the efficiency gain that this tool brings you. And that this tool represents many hundreds of hours of work. You may set a custom dev fee in the user_config, but it cannot be smaller than 1%. This donated processing power is accomplished by crunching projects under the developer's login. Don't worry, all crunching power still goes towards science!
 * **You can skip the dev fee by having a sidestake setup to the dev, which FTM will help you set up (if you want it) at first run**
 * You will see most of your project set to "no new tasks" except one, this is how FTM controls BOINC. Your "highest priority project" determined by expected crunch time vs actual (determined by project weight) will have tasks requested, and FTM will continue requesting tasks for each project until the work cache is full.
 * You can continue to use tools like BOINC Manager or BOINCTUI to monitor your crunching
 * You can stop the script at any time and regain manual control of your BOINC client, it will be reset to the settings which existed before FTM was run. This means that if you edit BOINC's preferences (such as computing preferences) while FTM is running, FTM will reset those settings upon being closed.
 * It will respect all pre-existing BOINC settings you have such as when to crunch or use the network. All this tool really does is set projects to "no new tasks" and request work from projects.
 * It is **strongly suggested** to have at least 10GB of free space for BOINC and that you allow BOINC to download at least 1 day of "extra" work. This helps project servers even out load and prevents this tool from getting confused. If you have a very small work cache and have profitability control enabled, you may occasionally run dry on work which is no fun. Otherwise, everything should be fine.

<b>How dev fee/crunching for dev works</b>
 * The dev fee by design does not kick in until you already have around 1000 hours of FTM usage under your belt. So it does come with a free trial! The revenue of the dev fee also supports Gridcoinstats which graciously hosts the stats needed for this tool to run, and to the Gridcoin foundation/community wallet.
 * The dev fee portion is skipped if you have elected to sidestake to the dev instead. This is suggested as it is simpler and will save you the disk space of a secondary BOINC install
 * Crunching for dev works by making a seperate BOINC install contained in the FindTheMag folder, set to take up no more than 10GB space. This BOINC install is attached to projects using the developer's username.
 * The secondary BOINC installed used to crunch for dev will respect the same settings your normal BOINC install is set to (whether or not to use GPU, # of cores, etc)

## Quickstart instructions
<b>For all platforms</b>: 
- Copy the `config.py` to `user_config.py` and change the settings you want in `user_config.py`.
- Python 3.8 or higher is required. A fully synced Gridcoin wallet is strongly suggested.

<h4>Windows</h4>

 - Download the latest version of python from python.org. Enable the "install to system path" option while installing.
 - In command prompt, run the command `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`
 - In command prompt, run `"cd C:\users\username\Downloads\FindTheMag-master"` or wherever you saved the tool
 - In command prompt, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - Double-click on main.py or run `python main.py` from command prompt. We suggest the second method as it will display errors if the program exits unexpectedly

<h4>Linux</h4>

 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd /home/user/Downloads/FindTheMag` or wherever you put it
 - Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (Note that you need pip installed, if you don't have it, you might need to run a `sudo apt install python3-pip`)
 - If you will be using FTM to control BOINC's crunching, give it permissions to edit BOINC settings with `sudo chown $USER /var/lib/boinc/global_prefs_override.xml`
 - Run `python3 main.py`

<h4>OS X</h4>

 - <b>Important</b> - If you want this tool to *control* BOINC on OS X: You must have the Gridcoin wallet installed and sidestaking to developer (script will offer to set this up for you) as the "crunching for dev" option does not work on OS X due to BOINC <a href="https://github.com/BOINC/boinc/issues/5069">not supporting</a> seperated installs on this platform.
 - Open a terminal and go to the folder you downloaded this tool into using `cd "/home/user/Downloads/FindTheMag"` or wherever you put it
 - Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
 - Run `python3 main.py`

### Notes on profitability:
This tool can be configured to only crunch when "profitable" based on Gridcoin's latest price. In order for this calculation to work correctly, you must input 
your local electric rates and rig wattage information into the user_config file. 

When you first run the tool, it will dedicate a minimum of 10 hours (or 5 WUs whichever comes first) of crunching to each project in "benchmarking"
mode. This is crucial to determining the profitability of a project since the amount of credit you earn on
differing hardware can vary significantly. Once each project has finished benchmarking, if it determines
the project is not profitable, it will stop requesting new work. Once six months have passed, it will again
request a new batch of work from the project to see if credit assignment, app efficiency, etc. has changed.
This prevents you ending up in a situation where all project have been determined to be "unprofitable" but
it never checks again to see if this is still true. 

### FAQ:
<b>I'm not getting as many coins as I expect or I haven't received my rewards?</b>

Consult the official Gridcoin help channels. If you are a solo miner, be sure you
have enabled GDPR export on projects which require it. See https://gridcoin.us/guides/whitelist.htm

<b>I'm getting some error while running the tool or need to contact you</b>

Open an issue here on github or email makeasnek{at}gmail.com.

<b>All my projects are set to "no new tasks"</b>

This behaviour is expected, it will leave the highest priority project to "allow new tasks" and the rest to "no new tasks". It occasionally cycles through all projects so you never run dry on work.

<b>I have no tasks?</b>

This is probably because you set ONLY_BOINC_IF_PROFITABLE to True in your user_config.py and no profitable projects were attached. Otherwise, if your projects actually have tasks available, it's a bug please report it.

<b>My BOINC client doesn't seem to be crunching according to the weight I assigned?</b>

Changing your resource share doesn't ensure that your machine will immediately start crunching according to those
resource shares, instead your BOINC client will gradually "catch up". For example, let's say you have a project which
you have recently assigned a weight of "one" to while your other projects add up to 100. Even though 1 is a very small
weight, if you have been crunching for six months and the project previously had a weight of zero, BOINC may fetch a
bunch of work-units to catch up so that it will have crunched that amount of weight over that entire time period. So for
that day, it may appear as if the project has a weight of 1000, but that's because it's average weight is still <1 and
it needs to catch up. You can configure the size of this window in the user_config file if you are directly controlling BOINC with FTM.

<b>How does it determine the most profitable project?</b>

Each project assigns credit for your work, and BOINC keeps track of how long that work took. The formula to figure out
the profitability of a project is below:

First it calculates the mag ratio: 

mag ratio =  project total magnitude / average total project RAC from last 30 days

Then you can get profitability (mag/hr): 

profitability = (total credits earned / time those credits took) * mag ratio 

<b>What if a project gets greylisted?</b>

FindTheMag will notice and crunch accordingly. If you have that project in your preferred projects, it will continue to be assigned weight. But if it's just a "mining" project, it will not be crunched.

<b>Why is it setting all these projects weights to 1?</b>

So that it can gradually accumulate enough stats to determine the profitability of these projects, and so those stats
continue to update as projects change how their applications and credit assignment work. Note that 1 = .1% of your machine's processing time since the total weight is 1000 not 100.

<b>What if there's a project I <i>never</i> want to crunch?</b>

If you have a grudge against a particular project, you can add it to the ignore list in the user_config file.

<b>What if there is more than one "most profitable" project?</b>

If they are within 10% of each other, project weight will be split evenly between them. This insures crunching will
continue even if one project runs out of work.

<b>What if I only want to crunch the most profitable project within a subset of projects, for example "only crunch the most profitable medical research project?"</b>

- Method 1: Only attach to projects in your desired category. Leave "preferred" projects blank
- Method 2: Attach to as many projects of any kind, set to "ignore" all projects outside set category

<b>Why don't you just say "crunch this project and if there's no work available, crunch this other project?"</b>

There are two answers to this question depending on how you use FTM.
- Setting weight manually via project websites or account managers: This isn't possible, because the BOINC client doesn't have this ability, nor the ability to have projects be in groups. It's open source
though so feel free to contribute to the BOINC project. 
- If you use FTM to directly control BOINC, it will always prioritize the "most wanted" project depending on whether most wanted is most profitable,
in your preferred projects list, etc.

<b>What about CPUs or GPUs? Or different applications?</b>

This tool doesn't know about GPUs or different apps, it just calculates an average credits/hour over all work units sent
to you by the project. It is generally adviseable to disable CPU tasks in your preferences on the project site 
if you are able to crunch GPU workunits since they generally grant more credit per watt and more credit per hour. But
ultimately the efficiency of crunching GPU vs CPU is up to the project and how they make their WUs. If you are using this
tool to directly control BOINC, it will work to make sure your CPU and GPU are always as fully utilized as possible.


<b>FTM keeps requesting tasks from or crunching a project even though it's not the highest priority?</b>

Probably because it's the only project with GPU support. FTM will keep going down the list of projects and requesting tasks until both your CPU *and* GPU cache are full. To avoid this, you can disable GPU crunching in BOINC. Be sure to exit FTM first before disabling in BOINC, as when FTM exits it will restore BOINC's settings to whatever they were when FTM started.

<b>What about if my hardware changes? If I add/remove a CPU/GPU?</b>

If you add hardware, FTM's estimate of each project's profitability will gradually approach the "new" number. If you remove hardware, there is a chance it never will, particularly if you have removed a GPU and not replaced it with another. This is because FTM will keep trying to request from GPU-only projects, get no new WUs, and therefore never update its stats. For this reason, if you remove a GPU, I would suggest removing and re-adding the projects in BOINC reinstalling FTM to reset your stats.

<b>How often should I re-check my stats with this?</b>

It's up to you, but it uses a 30-day average to calculate RAC:MAG ratios, so running it very frequently won't get you
much benefit. It's lightweight and doesn't hammer the BOINC project servers though, so feel free to run it as often as
you want!

<b>What are you going to name the pony?</b>

I don't know, current candidates are Jeffrey and Stargazer.

<b>What does "The following projects do not have enough stats to be calculated accurately" mean?</b>

It means you have completed less than 10 tasks for this project. At ten tasks, under ideal circumstances, we could get within 90% of the correct "credits per hour" estimation which is needed to determine mag per hour. So if less than 10 WUs have been completed, we don't even try to make an estimate.

<b>What if I can't run the Gridcoin wallet on my machine? For example, due to space limitations on my Raspberry Pi?</b>

As of FindTheMag 2.0, it will fetch the latest stats from Gridcoinstats.eu. You can also generate stats from non-local BOINC clients by gathering their log files and pointing the tool at them. You can copy your BOINC data directory to a machine that has the wallet running and point the script to it. Note that you don't need to copy any subfolders in the BOINC directory, just the root directory and files directly beneath it. [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) is a great tool for this.

<b>Any other tips for efficient crunching?</b>

Underclocking your CPU and GPU can improve the amount of compute you get
per watt. You will get work done slower, but often for a significant
decrease in power usage. Note that some projects like GPUGrid and Folding@home provide a bonus
for fast return of work so that must be factored in as well. In order of how profitable projects are, it tends to be (from most to least profitable) Math,
Physics, Health augmented by CPU/GPU ability.
